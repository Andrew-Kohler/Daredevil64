## Name
- 

## Goals
- Deilver demonstrations of each mechanic we develop
  - transition into tutorial levels

## Deliverables
- Mid-Semester: demo of the demo
- End of Semester: .exe file to run the game

## Tasks
- Conceptualize the mechanics
  - movement/jump
  - sound-based weapons
  - sound-based abilities
  - enemy noises
  - background elements emit noise when interacted with (sounds passes through them)
- Develop puzzle ideas based on mechanics

## Ideas
- different parts of the world/materials make different sounds or mute sounds more
- bell at the end of the level that when hit marks level complete and reveals the whole environment
- character movement: sprint, jump, wall jump
- for the ux: satisfying sound/particle effect upon successful movement

## Sprint 1
- Justin and Andrew: figure out the github issue with scene files
- Tyler and Riley: learn basics of Unity
